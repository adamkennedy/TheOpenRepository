Changes for Perl extension Perl-Dist-WiX

0.13_03 Fri 20 Feb 2009
    1. Internals use Object::InsideOut (I have to admit 
	   I was getting confused with all the inheritance.)
	   Perl::Dist::WiX[::Installer] still uses Object::Tiny
	   for backwards compatibility.
	2. Exception::Class also used (Makes it so errors 
	   change along with the trace level.)
	3. Tests reordered and categorized.

0.13_02 Thu 12 Feb 2009
    1. Test sequence completed. Passes, as well.

0.13_01 Mon 02 Feb 2009 
    1. Generates .msi file!
    2. Added routines to help make sure all files are installed.
    3. Updated to go with Perl::Dist 1.12 and Perl::Dist::Strawberry 1.09
    4. Icons handled.

0.11_07 Tue 27 Jan 2009
    1. Documentation completed.
    2. Trace now has 6 (0-5) levels.
    3. Directory creation simplified. (hopefully bug-free)
    4. Still no .msi yet.

0.11_06 Wed 21 Jan 2009
    1. Moved Feature.pm up one level, created FeatureTree.pm.   
    2. Spelling, a little documentation, bug fixes, tests.
       (more in _07)
    3. CPAN icon, get_component_array methods, build number, 
       beta number, and msi parameters added.
    4. Updated Perl::Dist::WiX to match Perl::Dist::Inno 1.11
    5. Creating all .wixout files required - but no .msi yet 
       (files are being counted twice)
    
0.11_05 Mon 19 Jan 2009
    1. Work in progress debugging routines install_win32_extras needs
    2. Documentation of some low-level modules added
    3. Compile test updated with all modules.
    4. Other tests skipped until rewriting done.
    5. Some parameter-checking added.

0.11_04 Sat 17 Jan 2009
    - Verified generation of fragments up to step 4 
      (install_perl_modules) now. (84 fragments, 900K)
    - Removed P::D::W::Toolchain, replaced it with ad-hoc
      _name_to_module method (I want to affect Perl::Dist 
      itself as little as possible)
    - Added more to list of modules that leave .packlist 
      files to check.
    - Removed create_string_fragment method (not being used)

0.11_03 Sat 17 Jan 2009
    - perl, the perl licenses, and the individual 
      modules of the Perl toolchain are now tested
      to generate fragments (now 57 fragments, about 
      800K .wxs source.)
    - Perl::Dist::WiX::Filelist module added to handle
      file list arithmetic and operations.
      
0.11_02 Thu 15 Jan 2009
    - First actual code:
      1: Most routines collect file names
      2: "low-level" routines create strings that 
         "work up the line" and get assembled.
      3: Individual portions of the C toolchain are
         individual wix fragments.
