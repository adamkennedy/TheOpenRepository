=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::WiX::Repository - The repository that is used for Perl::Dist::WiX.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the repository that Perl::Dist::WiX uses, and 
the branches that are currently being used as of August 2010.

=head1 REPOSITORY

Perl::Dist::WiX is currently on Adam Kennedy's "Open Repository" for CPAN 
authors, at L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/>

My understanding is that if you're a CPAN author, you can get commit access 
to it by asking Adam Kennedy for it. His e-mail address is 
C<< adamk@cpan.org >>.

If you aren't a CPAN author and need commit access for Perl::Dist::WiX, please 
e-mail me with what you'd like to do (a patch would be nice) and I'll 
recommend to him that you be given access.

In any case, before committing anything more than minor changes to the 
Perl-Dist-WiX trunk or current branches, please e-mail me.  I'll probably 
say yes, but I need to know what you're planning to do, so that I don't 
accidentally step on your changes.

You may wish to work on your own branch, and then communicate with me to 
get it merged into the trunk, by doing:

	svn cp http://svn.ali.as/trunk/Perl-Dist-WiX/ http://svn.ali.as/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/<branch_name>

=head1 BRANCHES

=head2 Trunk 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-WiX/>

The trunk right now has 3 goals for October 2010:

=over

=item 1.

Making the supported versions of Perl pluggable. This way, the 
C<Perl::Dist::WiX> distribution itself is smaller.

=item 2.

5.12.2 support (when it comes out).

=item 3.

Making what distroprefs we have inheritable (probably by making a 
subdirectory of the build directory to copy them into.)

=item 4.

Being able to build from a merge module in a relocated directory.

=item 5.

Fixing other bugs, including adding support for C<Moose> 1.09.

=back

=head2 April 2010 maintenance branch.

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/July-2010-maintenance/>

This branch exists for the sole purpose of rebuilding Strawberry Perl 5.10.1 
and 5.12.0 if there are major problems before October 2010. Changes on this 
branch are HIGHLY discouraged.

This branch will be deleted upon the release of the October 2010 versions 
of Strawberry Perl, and a new branch will be created to maintain that 
version.
