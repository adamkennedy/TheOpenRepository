=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::WiX::Repository - The repository that is used for Perl::Dist::WiX.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the repository that Perl::Dist::WiX uses, and the
branches that are currently being used as of August 2009.

=head1 REPOSITORY

Perl::Dist::WiX is currently on Adam Kennedy's "Open Repository" for CPAN 
authors, at L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/>

My understanding is that if you're a CPAN author, you can get commit access 
to it by asking Adam Kennedy for it. His e-mail address is 
C<< adamk@cpan.org >>.

If you aren't a CPAN author and need commit access for Perl::Dist::WiX, please 
e-mail me with what you'd like to do (a patch would be nice) and I'll recommend 
to him that you be given access.

In any case, before committing anything more than minor changes to the Perl-Dist-WiX 
trunk or branches, please e-mail me.  I'll probably say yes, but I need to know what 
you're planning to do, so that I don't accidentally step on your changes.

=head1 BRANCHES

The trunk is currently unstable at the moment, due to the fact that the code 
is in the process of changing from using L<Object::InsideOut|Object::InsideOut>
and L<Object::Tiny|Object::Tiny> to L<Moose|Moose>.

Yes, I know Moose is "heavy" in the dependencies and initial loading time. 
The problems are that Object::Tiny is a little TOO tiny for what I need, 
and Object::InsideOut objects that contain other Object::InsideOut objects 
are very difficult to make L<Storable>, which breaks checkpointing.

Plus, with Moose, I gain the ability to check constructor parameters better,
the ability to extend logging, and the ability to factor out the XML generation
and handling to another distribution in a sane matter.

So here are the 4 branches:

=head2 Trunk 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-WiX/>

The trunk right now has 4 goals for October:

=over

=item 1.

5.10.1 support.

=item 2.

Moosification.

=item 3.

Refactoring the WiX.pm and Installer.pm modules into smaller modules.

=item 4.

Including the Perl::Dist::Asset and Perl::Dist::Util sets of modules into 
the Perl::Dist::WiX distribution.

=back

Returning to stability is also important.

=head2 July 2009 maintenance branch.

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/July-2009-maintenance/>

This branch exists for the sole purpose of rebuilding Strawberry Perl 5.8.9 and 5.10.0 if there are major problems before October 2009. Changes on this branch are HIGHLY discouraged.

=head2 5.10.1 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/5.10.1/>

This branch exists for the sole purpose of building Strawberry Perl 5.10.1 release candidates until the trunk is stable and passes tests again.

Changes will only be included in this branch for functionality related to building Strawberry Perl 5.10.1.

=head2 "Vendorperl"

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/branches/Perl-Dist-WiX/vendorperl/>)

This was experimental code for having modules provided by Strawberry Perl install 
into a "vendor" directory, instead of using the "site" directories.

This code will be incorporated into the trunk once it is stable again.
