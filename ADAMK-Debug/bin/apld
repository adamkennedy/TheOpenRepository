=head1 NAME

apld - Adam's Perl Debugger

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a small script which provides a sanity layer for debugging test
scripts in Perl distributions.

While L<prove> has is highly useful program for manually running one or
more scripts, when debugging you want some similar things to happen, but
is of only limited use in a debugging context.

This script checks that the environment is sound, runs some cleanup tasks
if needed, makes sure you are in the right directory, and then hands off
to the perl debugger as normal.
