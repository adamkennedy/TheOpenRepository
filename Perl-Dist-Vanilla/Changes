Revision history for Vanilla Perl

Build 7:

    - Added mingw32-make binary to mingw

    - Installs CPAN-1.87_55 for better handling of missing command line
      programs and no unnecessary prompting for Module::Signature

Build 6: Sun Jul  9 16:59:55 EDT 2006

    - switched to Perl::Dist::Builder as the generator and Module::Install
      for Makefile.PL

    - backported .iss changes from Strawberry Alpha 1; added .iss build 
      script to bin/

    - perl path no longer prepended

    - added Time::Local and Archive::Tar to eliminate need for binary unzip

    - tweaked preloaded CPAN\Config.pm

    - minor doc cleanup

Build 5: Wed Jul  5 20:28:00 EST 2006

    - updated META.yml no_index (hopefully) prevent spurious indexing by
      CPAN.pm
      
    - pulled mock Module::Signature from the distribution (not being used
      in Vanilla -- wait for Strawberry instead)

    - added a MANIFEST.SKIP file

Build 4: Wed Jul  5 12:37:22 EST 2006

    - Build now generated programmatically from scripts released in
      Perl::Dist::Vanilla

    - Added Win32API::File, Compress::Zlib, IO::Zlib, Archive::Tar and 
      Net::FTP to satisfy CPAN dependencies without needed external binaries
    
    - Removed UnxUtils binaries (no longer necessary)
    
    - Added latest IO for IO::Socket fixes
    
    - Removed libwin32 (except for Win32API::File as described above) to get
      back to a minimial set of modules. (libwin32 can be cleanly installed
      directly from CPAN now)

    - Removed additional "tools" directory that had libwin32 dependencies;
      Description of path changes moved to README

    - Automatically sets PATH, LIB, and INCLUDE environment variables
      during installation; Path to perl is prepended to avoid any other
      perl executables bundled in the path (e.g. windows SVK)
    
    - Moved dmake binaries into their own directory

    - Relocated license files; included missing MinGW win32api license

    - Updated Vanilla Perl documentation, license and README

    - No longer sets FTP_PASSIVE environment variable -- sets this instead
      in the libnet default configuration file

    - Removed restriction on installing for Windows 95, 98, etc. as some 
      developers have requested the ability to test on these platforms.  
      Minimum version restrictions may/should be added to other, end-user-
      oriented releases like Strawberry Perl
      
Build 3:

    - executable installer release on SourceForge

Build 2:

    - source release on SourceForge

Build 1:

    - first release for the original "Vertical Metre of Beer" challenge
