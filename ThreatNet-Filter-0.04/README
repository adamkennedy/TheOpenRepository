NAME
    ThreatNet::Filter - Interface for ThreatNet event filters

DESCRIPTION
    ThreatNet data sources can potentially generate a hell of a lot of
    events, and it's important to be able to filter these down to just the
    events that matter.

    Many of the filters are stateful. For example, the standard
    ThreatNet::Filter::ThreatCache module provides cache objects that filter
    out any threats that have already been seen in the previous hour. (or
    whatever the state period is).

METHODS
    The filter API is quite simple, with only a few methods.

  new ...
    Since some categories of filter do not strictly need to be in the form
    of an object, a default "new" constructor is provided which just creates
    an empty object.

    Returns a new "ThreatNet::Filter" object, or some sub-classes may return
    "undef" on error.

  keep $Message
    The "keep" method takes a ThreatNet::Message object and examines it to
    determine if the message should be kept, or filtered out.

    In the default implementation of the filter, all messages are kept.

    Returns true if the message should be kept, or false if the message
    should be discarded.
