1.001 - 17 Aug 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Integrate version 0.90 of libjio
  + Remove generated files from the repository
  + Update MANIFEST.SKIP's paths so that libjio's Makefile
    isn't skipped
  + Move the version test inside the SKIP block -- doesn't
    make sense to run it if it's not installed; this should
    fix the CPAN Testers errors (thanks hobbs@freenode #perl)
  + Use a simple string version, per David Golden's article:
    http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/
  + No longer use Perl::Critic to test

1.0.4 - 26 Jul 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Fix core tests to correct regression in version 1.0.3

1.0.3 - 25 Jul 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Changed the method of probing @PATH for gmake, now we don't
    need to execute which
  + Added information about Test Coverage
  + Added some commands so that the void context paths are touched
    (increases coverage a bit)
  + Update documentation
  + Overhaul test scripts, remove author tests from Recommends
    (Alias' journal #5375)
  + Update LICENSE and README (no longer generate a readme, just
    use a simple one)

1.0.2 - 01 Jul 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + New upstream release: libjio 0.51 (release 2009-06-30)
  + Better detection with ENV{MAKE} (uses gmake if on BSD)
  + There are no Ruby bindings, so remove that from the Build.PL
    prompt asking if they should be installed

1.0.1 - 18 Jun 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + No longer enforce "one dot only" in filenames. This breaks

    stuff for those in Alien/Libjio.pm
  + Added limitation warnings
  + Use a safer ENV{PATH}
  + Don't do ExtUtils::Liblist twice in t/02core.t
  + Revert dependency on version.pm to 0.74
