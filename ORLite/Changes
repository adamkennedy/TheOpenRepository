Changes for Perl extension ORLite

1.22 Mon  1 Jun 2009
	- Updated to Module::Install::DSL 0.91
	- Split out debug/eval as (undocument) dval function
	- App support for a (currently undocumented) 'append'
	  param to allow sub-classes like ORLite::Mirror to merge
	  in additional code to the generated class.

1.21 Sun 24 May 2009
	- Updated to Module::Install::DSL 0.88
	- Added commit_begin and rollback_begin to allow persisting
	  of the connection between successive transactions.

1.20 Thu 12 Feb 2009
	- Auto-create parent directory for ORLite files
	- Add root method ->sqlite which returns the path to the
	  sqlite file for that database.

1.19 Tue  3 Feb 2009
	- Adding support for using a CODE reference in the 'create'
	  parameter, so that the schema setup can be provided directly
	  in the ORLite initialisation.

1.18 Wed 14 Jan 2009
	- Adding an ->orlite method to return the version number of the
	  ORLite module that was used to generate the distribution.

1.17 Sat  3 Jan 2009
	- Adding a ->truncate method to each table

1.16 Sat 14 Dec 2008
	- The fact that I didn't need to change ORLite for ORLite::Migrate
	  suggests that it's stable enough for general use (pending 2.0)

0.15 Wed 24 Sep 2008
	- Adding support for writable pragmas
	- Adding tests for pragmas, schema_version and user_version

0.14 Tue 23 Sep 2008
	- Removed the last remnants of %ORLite::DSN and %ORLite::DBH.
	- Added support for the "create" param to allow database creation

0.13 Fri 19 Sep 2008
	- Fixed critical bug introduced in 0.10 or somewhere around there,
	  where column accessors were not defined for readonly classes.
	  (This fatally killed ORLite::Mirror)

0.12 Mon 15 Sep 2008
	- Don't store the database values in a shared hash any more
	  (Makes the classes self-contained and able to run without ORLite)
        - Add a tables param to the import, to allow the base database
          connectivity class to be created without the table classes.

0.11 Tue  9 Sep 2008
	- If we aren't debugging we don't need to write the temp file

0.10 Wed  6 Aug 2008
        - Quote all column names for explicitness

0.09 Fri 11 Jul 2008
	- Adding pragma method to the top package
	- Adding user_version import param to provide the ability
	  to lock the Perl code against a known-good schema.

0.08 Tue 24 Jun 2008
	- Adding an experimental -DEBUG option

0.07 Wed 28 May 2008
	- Actually trust the package param

0.06 Wed 28 May 2008
	- Don't add transaction support if we are readonly

0.05 Tue 27 May 2008
	- Minor bug fixes in the ->import method
	- Correcting the RT link in the POD.

0.04 Tue 27 May 2008
	- Added ->import( \%hash ) support.
	- Added support for custom passing of the target package.
	- Added support for readonly database loading
	  (We need this for doing mirrored remote db support)
	- Autodetect readonly SQLite files

0.03 Thu 22 May 2008
	- Added initial foreign key support
	- Added the POD documentation for ORLite root packages
	- Added File::Spec dependency
