NAME
    ThreatNet::Topic - An object representation of a ThreatNet channel topic

DESCRIPTION
    ThreatNet is an evolving idea. This standalone module defines a topic
    format and an object to hold it. ThreatNet itself is not yet available.

    A proposal generally defining what it might be is available at:

    <http://ali.as/devel/threatnetwork.html>

METHODS
  new $topic
    The "new" constructor takes a new ThreatNet topic string and creates an
    object that represents it.

    A ThreatNet topic should look like the following

      threatnet://host/path configuration

    That is, it should start with a 'threatnet' URI identifier in the same
    style as XML namespace URIs, containing at least the host and path
    components, following an arbitrary string most likely representing the
    configuration and rules of the channel, with a format defined by the
    protocol.

    Returns a new ThreatNet::Topic object or "undef" if the string is not a
    valid ThreatNet topic string.

  topic
    Accessor method that returns the Topic as a topic string.

  URI
    Accessor method that returns the protocol identifier as a URI object

  config
    Accessor method that returns the non-required protocol-specific part of
    the topic, which is assumed to hold the channel configuration.
