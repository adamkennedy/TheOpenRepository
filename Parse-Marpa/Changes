1.005_002 Wed Dec 16 09:46:04 PST 2009
1.005_001 Mon Dec 14 19:05:04 PST 2009
    Making sure cpantesters is happy with the new regression test.

1.005_000 Sun Dec 13 09:48:34 PST 2009
    RT#52724: Same as RT#45136.
    Obviously my previous fix was not real good.

1.004000 Wed Apr 29
    Fixed RT#45136: Non-existent functions called on certain parse
    errors.

1.002000 Wed Jan 21

    Many perlcritic fixes.

    Improvements to the messages the user gets from the Perl 5 code he
    passes to Marpa.  User code is used in many places.  Most importantly,
    the semantics of the grammar are specified with Perl 5 code.  So good
    error messages are important.

0.205_nnn Sat Mar 22

    A series of developer's releases.

    As of 0.205_000, I adopted a system where odd minor releases (0.205,
    0.207, etc.) are developer-only releases and even-numbered minor
    releases (0.202, 0.206, etc.) are general releases.

0.202.0 Thu Jan 17

    First Alpha Release

0.200.0 Tue Jan 15

    First Candidate for Alpha Release

    The big jump in version numbers is because the earliest releases used a different
    version number format, and are later in ASCII collating sequence.  As of this release,
    the latest version number is after all others in ASCII collating order.
