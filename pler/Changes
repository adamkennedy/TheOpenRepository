Revision history for Perl extension pler

0.20 Thu  2 Aug 2007
	- Moving bin/pler to the more standard script/pler
	- Collapse Devel::Pler into pler.pm
	- Adding support for regenerating the Makefile from Makefile.PL
	  (only on Win32, because the Makefile is not capable of regenerating)

0.19 skipped

0.18 Wed 16 May 2007
        - Adding the ability to run scripts from the t directory
        - Moving pler.pm to Devel::Pler
        - Moving bin/pler to pler.pm
        - Added a stubbed launch script as bin/pler

        - Fixing a path bug that breaks Test::Files
	- Updated Test::Script dependency to 1.02

0.16 Tue  2 Jan 2007
	- Fixed a test bug I thought I'd fixed already

0.15 Mon  1 Jan 2007
	- Converted from Devel::Pler to just pler.pm to allow
	  for better installation and documentation on search.cpan.

0.14 Fri 15 Sep 2006
	- exec() does not work on Win32 (and we assume cygwin).
	  Instead, use system() which uses more memory, but
	  does at least work.

0.13 Thu  3 Aug 2006
	- Bug fixes
	  (I honestly don't know his this crap gets out to CPAN)

0.12 Thu 25 Jul 2006
	- Show the list of scripts with no params, or run script
	  if there is only one in the t directory.
	- When verbose is off, comment on the script name for clarity
	- Copying the POD in the Devel::Pler for better toolchain
	  compatibility.
