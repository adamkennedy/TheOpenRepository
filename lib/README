NAME
    lib - manipulate @INC at compile time

SYNOPSIS
        use lib LIST;

        no lib LIST;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a small simple module which simplifies the manipulation of @INC
    at compile time.

    It is typically used to add extra directories to perl's search path so
    that later "use" or "require" statements will find modules which are not
    located on perl's default search path.

  Adding directories to @INC
    The parameters to "use lib" are added to the start of the perl search
    path. Saying

        use lib LIST;

    is *almost* the same as saying

        BEGIN { unshift(@INC, LIST) }

    For each directory in LIST (called $dir here) the lib module also checks
    to see if a directory called $dir/$archname/auto exists. If so the
    $dir/$archname directory is assumed to be a corresponding architecture
    specific directory and is added to @INC in front of $dir.

    The current value of $archname can be found with this command:

        perl -V:archname

    To avoid memory leaks, all trailing duplicate entries in @INC are
    removed.

  Deleting directories from @INC
    You should normally only add directories to @INC. If you need to delete
    directories from @INC take care to only delete those which you added
    yourself or which you are certain are not needed by other modules in
    your script. Other modules may have added directories which they need
    for correct operation.

    The "no lib" statement deletes all instances of each named directory
    from @INC.

    For each directory in LIST (called $dir here) the lib module also checks
    to see if a directory called $dir/$archname/auto exists. If so the
    $dir/$archname directory is assumed to be a corresponding architecture
    specific directory and is also deleted from @INC.

  Restoring original @INC
    When the lib module is first loaded it records the current value of @INC
    in an array @lib::ORIG_INC. To restore @INC to that value you can say

        @INC = @lib::ORIG_INC;

CAVEATS
    In order to keep lib.pm small and simple, it only works with Unix
    filepaths. This doesn't mean it only works on Unix, but non-Unix users
    must first translate their file paths to Unix conventions.

        # VMS users wanting to put [.stuff.moo] into 
        # their @INC would write
        use lib 'stuff/moo';

NOTES
    In the future, this module will likely use File::Spec for determining
    paths, as it does now for Mac OS (where Unix-style or Mac-style paths
    work, and Unix-style paths are converted properly to Mac-style paths
    before being added to @INC).

    If you try to add a file to @INC as follows:

      use lib 'this_is_a_file.txt';

    "lib" will warn about this. The sole exceptions are files with the
    ".par" extension which are intended to be used as libraries.

SEE ALSO
    FindBin - optional module which deals with paths relative to the source
    file.

    PAR - optional module which can treat ".par" files as Perl libraries.

    For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
        my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
        script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
        said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
        object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
        terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
        of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
        resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
        consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
        equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
        may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
        or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
        Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
        to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
        a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
        offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
        fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
        is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
        of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
        my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
        spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.
