Changes file for Text::Diff

0.35 Tue Aug 27 13:53:23 EDT 2002
    - Escape whitespace if a blank line is inserted or removed.  This
      puts a "\n" in the column containing the blank line, for instance.

0.34 Sun Jul 14 07:02:51 EDT 2002
    - Improved Table format's escaping
        - that "\t" and "\\t" are displayed differently
	- the entire line is escaped consistently if it is escaped
	  at all.

0.33 Mon Jul  8 16:29:01 EDT 2002
    - Make diff() return "" instead of 0 when comparing two empty
      things.  Patch from Rolf Grossmann <grossman@progtech.net>.

0.32 Thu Mar 14 13:37:51 EST 2002
    - Fix escaping of all-whitespace strings.

0.31 Wed Feb  6 05:36:47 EST 2002
    - Remove stray $SIG{__DIE__} that was confessing on every die.

0.3 Undocumented (sorry)

0.11 Mon Dec 10 06:23:00 EST 2001
    - Remove hardcoded date string from t/general.t's test data, because
      localtime is used to generate this in Diff.pm and the local machine's
      timezone (and locale?) can cause the localtime for a given mtime to be
      quite different.  Reported by  Andreas Marcel Riechert
      <riechert@pobox.com> of cpan-testers.
    - Start this Changes file.
    - Added hunk_header() and hunk_footer() for symmetry in overloading.
    - Added t/ext_format.t

0.1
    - Initial public release.
    - Added filename, filehandle, and string I/O options
    - API resembles Algorithm::Diff's a bit more
    - Reimplement output formats as classes so that external (user-supplied)
      can be specified as class names (My::Diff::Format) and so that they may
      be inherited from.  Should probably break out hunk_header() from hunk().
    - Add footer() to all formats
