Revision history for Perl extension Chart::Math::Axis.

0.3  Sat Mar 20 2004
	- Updated Math::BigInt dependency to 1.70 to force them to upgrade

0.2  Sun Aug 24 2003 16:19:15
	- API to Math::BigFloat appears to have lost the ->copy method,
	  so I'm replacing that with a call to Clone::clone

0.1  Thu Oct 22 2002 16:32:52
	- original version
